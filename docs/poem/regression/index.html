		<p>The colonizer was the adult.</p>

<p>A flurry of invention<br />
Novelty run amok<br />
He stood astride the continent<br />
Leaving a rock-solid foundation for child-scholars<br />
He learned at home and taught abroad<br />
Mastery embodied<br />
</p>

<p>An agonizing moment of self-doubt paralyzed him<br />
To pick up the pieces, to leave the pieces where they lay<br />
He knew them better than they knew themselves<br />
But the trap was laid, the infestation given sustenance<br />
What he brought, they took</p>

<p>He despised his new neighbors despite his enlightenment<br />
He had taught but must he learn?<br />
They tried teaching him but his mind wasn’t in it<br />
Mastery threatened</p>

<p>They laugh and carry on in their Brooklyn barber shops<br />
They know him, they learned what he taught<br />
He doesn’t know them, he didn’t learn what they tried to teach<br />
Now his naiveté relentlessly looms overhead</p>

<p>The colonizer is the child.</p>
