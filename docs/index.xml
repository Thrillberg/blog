      <title>Blitz Go Is Such a Bad Idea</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I accidentally played a blitz game of Go, which is something I generally try to avoid. I prefer to play live games, but with a bit more time than 30 seconds per move.&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whether Spartan or Trojan,&lt;br /&gt;
Montgomery or Rommel,&lt;br /&gt;
Union or Confederate,&lt;br /&gt;
We will withhold judgment&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>On Heroic Statues</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although some time has passed since our country was acutely fixated on historical statues and their meaning, I feel ready now to make a comment in prose. I actually already made a comment in the form of a poem (which will appear here shortly, after I edit it a bit more), but my thoughts have clarified a bit and I think my opinion is more well-founded. My conclusion, when it comes to how to deal with questionable or controversial statues is best summarized as follows: 1) if the statue depicts a person or hero who has done immoral things and perhaps is even best known for immoral acts, the local population should decide how to proceed, but 2) if the statue depicts a person or hero who was an enemy of the country, the federal level has the right and responsibility of acting to de-heroize the person.&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The colonizer was the adult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A flurry of invention&lt;br /&gt;
Novelty run amok&lt;br /&gt;
He stood astride the continent&lt;br /&gt;
Leaving a rock-solid foundation for child-scholars&lt;br /&gt;
He learned at home and taught abroad&lt;br /&gt;
Mastery embodied&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;</description>
