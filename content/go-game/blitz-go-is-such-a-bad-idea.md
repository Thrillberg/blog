I accidentally played a blitz game of Go, which is something I generally try to avoid. I prefer to play live games, but with a bit more time than 30 seconds per move.

In any event, I felt awful about this game (I play white here) from move 12 onward. I felt like I've seen move 11 before but obviously didn't know how to follow it up (that is, if it was a real move to begin with). In any event, I ended up barely winning despite a luckily alive group in the lower left and and stupidly dead group in the upper right. I guess I was vaguely successful with a moyo-based game but the end-game set in far too early and, I think, is a sign that we both weren't giving this game much thought.


So there it is, in all it's embarrassing glory.
