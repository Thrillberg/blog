The colonizer was the adult.

A flurry of invention
Novelty run amok
He stood astride the continent
Leaving a rock-solid foundation for child-scholars
He learned at home and taught abroad
Mastery embodied
<!--more-->

An agonizing moment of self-doubt paralyzed him
To pick up the pieces, to leave the pieces where they lay
He knew them better than they knew themselves
But the trap was laid, the infestation given sustenance
What he brought, they took

He despised his new neighbors despite his enlightenment
He had taught but must he learn?
They tried teaching him but his mind wasn’t in it
Mastery threatened

They laugh and carry on in their Brooklyn barber shops
They know him, they learned what he taught
He doesn’t know them, he didn’t learn what they tried to teach
Now his shadowy naiveté looms to infect with ignorance

The colonizer is the child.
