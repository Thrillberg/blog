Whether Spartan or Trojan,
Montgomery or Rommel,
Union or Confederate,
We will withhold judgment
<!--more-->

Anchors of honor,
Equestrian postures,
You are between God and Man
You transcend right and wrong

Rise to submission
Do the explicit
Fear the implicit
We all shed our agency
And aim to emulate

On the Westphalian model there are no poles
We find comfort in our horse-blinders

Your hand is forced
And your autonomy obliterated
Congratulations on your promotion
Your salary, paid in esteem, will be accordingly increased
So take your posthumous fame
After all, the dead cannot speak
