Although some time has passed since our country was acutely fixated on historical statues and their meaning, I feel ready now to make a comment in prose. I actually already made a comment in the form of a poem (which will appear here shortly, after I edit it a bit more), but my thoughts have clarified a bit and I think my opinion is more well-founded. My conclusion, when it comes to how to deal with questionable or controversial statues is best summarized as follows: 1) if the statue depicts a person or hero who has done immoral things and perhaps is even best known for immoral acts, the local population should decide how to proceed, but 2) if the statue depicts a person or hero who was an enemy of the country, the federal level has the right and responsibility of acting to de-heroize the person.

I'll take on part 2 first, as it concerns Confederate warriors. Now, my true conviction is that people (especially warriors; I will likely be writing about or at least referring to my pacifism in the future) should not be made to be heroes. If we tore all the statues of heroes down, I'd be cool with that. However, as a matter of policy that would be more palatable to the general population, my prescription is detailed herein. I agree with the premise of Trump's implied argument that if we start scrutinizing the past too closely we end up with no heroes because everyone has faults (again, I have no problem with this extreme but I'm only outlining what I think should be a policy solution). He's not wrong. But this doesn't mean that we can't draw a line somewhere, and I think treason is a perfectly fine place to draw the line.

So, yes, if local Bostonians want their Faneuil Hall named after a slave trader, they should have that right. If Bostonians democratically decide against it, then rename it. This is all local politics. Faneuil may be problematic and we may rightly judge him harshly but I'm inclined to more leniency in the federal government allowing this to stay as is. I would, of course, support those Bostonians who want it changed though.

The federal government has a much bigger interest in keeping its sovereignty intact as a larger governmental body. Therefore, traitors and enemies of the federal government (including such polarizing figures as Edward Snowden who I suppose is a traitorous semi-hero) should be kept tucked away in the history books as cautionary tales, not lionized heroes. The Confederacy fits these two descriptors ("traitor" and "enemy to the United States") perfectly. Confederates would likely agree. So, it's in the federal government's purview to remove these statues.

I've made a fairly pat answer to the quandary and it leaves many questions unanswered. This is by design, as the above is what I feel more strongly sure about. I will enumerate a few potential rebuttals or other perspectives below and answer them earnestly. In general, however, I believe I will be on shakier ground so any sort of principled approach may be compromised by my day-to-day political leanings.

1) What about when people break the law to tear down statues?

This is probably the single biggest inner conflict I feel about this issue. I believe in the rule of law. Especially in our current climate when this rule is being threatened by the highest levels of government (cough, Trump, cough), I think it's generally safe to rely on our laws to be good or at least good enough. But moral law is certainly supreme over our codified law, if only moral law were clear-cut. In this instance, I believe the moral righteousness of those who break the law to tear down illegitimate statues to be correct, but it's hard for me to cleanly say that they should also not face a penalty for their actions. I'm not satisfied with this "split the baby" solution, but politics is hard. Still, I donated to the legal defense fund for those who were arrested for taking down the Confederate statue in Durham.

2) Wait, so you don't think we should have any heroic statues? What would sit on those pedestals?

Potentially nothing. Or maybe actual heroes. Like impactful scientists or moral thinkers. Or people who fought for political and civil rights. Or dedications to those who suffer unduly in our society. Hell, even successful businesspeople whose products helped us. Or nothing. The bottom line here is that people who go to war, supposedly on the behalf of the defense of Americans, are categorically not heroes. Again, this gets to my pacifism, which may need to wait for another day.

3) What good is it to be so keen on the federal government stepping in when you know the guy at the top has absolutely zero interest in doing the right thing?

In terms of practical results, this is a fair point. While these statues have been standing with (relatively) little controversy (not to say zero controversy) for years, this moment is as good a time as any to acquire some clarity on where we, as a society, stand on how to remember our heroes (and deciding who is a hero). So even if they're unactionable, let's get these opinions and thoughts straight so that one day, we can make it the norm that certain governmental bodies act in the ways we expect them to.
