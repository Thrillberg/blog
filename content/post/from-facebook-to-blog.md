I've been on Facebook for many years. I took a long break some years ago and then got back on to keep in touch with a number of new friends. Lately, I've found myself more and more addicted to Facebook, thanks in large part to the news of 2017. I'd like to quit this habit but I still want to engage online. Hence, this blog.

I'll be writing about whatever is on my mind. I have a few poems to share so I'll be sharing those over the next few days I imagine. And I hope to write more poems. But beyond that I will also write my thoughts on news, which I find more and more necessary to get out. And I might just put technical stuff on here too, but I wouldn't count on it.

I'm staying on Twitter--I'm not going 100% luddite.
